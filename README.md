# Sample_Tree

The **SampleBioShift** pipeline runs the **SampleTree** workflow and **BioShift** simultaneously.  
`SampleBioShift.py` is a small orchestration script that runs the full analysis pipeline for a given patient/sample set, keeping the project directory clean and reproducible.

Make sure you have both **R** and **Python** installed, with the necessary packages. Please check `requirements.txt` for installation details.
